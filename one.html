    <h1 class="titles">What is Cthulhu?</h1>
    <p>Cthulhu is a fictional cosmic entity created by writer H. P. Lovecraft. It was first introduced in his short
        story "The Call of Cthulhu",[2] published by the American pulp magazine Weird Tales in 1928. Considered a Great
        Old One within the pantheon of Lovecraftian cosmic entities, this creature has since been featured in numerous
        popular culture references.
        <col> Lovecraft depicts it as a gigantic entity worshipped by cultists, in a shape like a
        green octopus, dragon, and a caricature of human form. Its name was given to the Lovecraft-inspired universe,
        the Cthulhu Mythos, where it exists with its fellow entities.</p>
